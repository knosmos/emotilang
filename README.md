# Emotilang: an intuitive emoji-based scripting language
Emotilang (short for "emoticon language") is a versatile scripting language where every character is emoji.
Because of this, there are no language barriers. Printing text to the command line is just 🖨️, and the curly braces of most
programming languages are replaced with a far more intuitive 🏁 and 🛑. By having every command have a physical connection,
Emotilang is extremely intuitive and easy to learn.
